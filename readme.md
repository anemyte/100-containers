# 100 containers

Various useful stuff in containers with [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). Contents:

1. [Auth proxy for Docker registry](nginx-docker-registry-auth-proxy): use private registry without `docker login`. 
1. [NGINX Print All Request Headers](nginx-print-request-headers): set up a proxy to a real service and see what headers are coming through proxy.
1. [NGINX Configuration Helper](nginx-test-config): experiment with NGINX configuration.

More to come later.
