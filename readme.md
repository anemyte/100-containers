# 100 containers

Various (for a DevOps at least) useful stuff in containers. Check readme in subdirectories.

Contents:

1. [Auth proxy for Docker registry](nginx-docker-registry-auth-proxy): use private registry without `docker login`. 
1. [NGINX Print All Request Headers](nginx-print-request-headers): set up a proxy to a real service and see what headers an app passes with requests.

More to come later.
